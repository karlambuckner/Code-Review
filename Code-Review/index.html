  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Karla and I'm 27 years old. I live in beautiful Portland, Oregon. I decided to take on programming through Epicodus after developing a liking for learning how to code. I started out learning code by practicing online through Codecademy tutorials. I have a degree in Psychology but decided I was more passionate about web development and programming.
      <br></br>
      My hobbies and interests include: photography, playing guitar, baking, hiking, taking road trips and traveling. And coding of course!</p>
